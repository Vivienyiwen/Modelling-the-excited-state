## Introduction
Worth[^1] and co-workers developed and improved a vibronic model to describe the dynamics of benzene in the many states included in their research. However, the computational cost of these methods makes it impractical to utilize for bigger systems. Therefore, the goal of this study is to see if cheaper excited state approaches like TD-DFT can be used with the vibronic Hamiltonian to describe excited state PESs14.

## Conclusion and future work
The main goal of this paper was to examine the use of TD-DFT in combination with a vibronic Hamiltonian for modeling the excited state PES. We looked at four different DFT functionals in this work: BLYP, B3LYP, CAM-B3LYP, and IP-tuned CAM-B3LYP. Starting with the on-diagonal vibronic coupling constants, the TD-DFT results were found to agree reasonably well with the literature. Next, we expanded our model to include the off-diagonal coupling constants. From the results, the final obtained model presents a good result, but there is still room for improvement. Overall, our results suggest that TD-DFT may be a possible tool for subsequent researchers to further study the excited state PES of larger macromolecules.
